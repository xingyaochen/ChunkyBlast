We added two files in addition to the starter code provided:
hmmmodel.py: the profile HMM model class, which takes in the seeds file and constructs
            the probabilistic model. The class has data structures that store the 
            matching states, emission probabilities as well as the transition probabilities.

hmmAlign.py: the alignment class. Takes in a profile HMM model object generated from hmmmodel.py,
            aligns the searching sequence against the profile HMM model and use
            viterbi algorithm to calculate the best alignment score.
            The class also has a function "subtractShuffleMean()" that subtract the mean score of
            of aligning shuffled sequences from the score of alignning the original
            searching sequence.

alignOne.py and search.py depends on both of the above files.
